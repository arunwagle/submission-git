DEFINITIONS: (cont.):Location: 1) Electrical equipment and equipment used for the transmission of voice, data or video.
2) Electrical, fuel, gas, water, steam, refrigeration, sewerage, voice, data or video transmission lines.
Pollutant Clean Up and Removal: The Company will pay the necessary and reasonable expense incurred by the Insured to extract “pollutants” from land or water at the Insured’s premises if the discharge, dispersal, seepage, migration, release or escape of the “pollutants” is caused by or results from a “specified cause of loss” which occurs during the policy period.
Such expenses will be paid only if reported to the Company in writing within 180 days of the date on which the “specified cause of loss” occurs.
This Coverage does not apply to costs to test for, monitor or assess the existence, concentration or effects of “pollutants”. But the Company will pay for testing which is performed in the course of extracting the “pollutants” from the land or water.
The most the Company will pay under this Coverage for the sum of all covered expenses arising out of all ”specified cause of loss” occurrences that occur during each separate 12 month period of this policy is the Limit of Insurance specified for Pollutant Cleanup and Removal shown in the Supplemental Coverage Declarations.
Debris Removal: This policy insures the following expenses resulting from a covered cause of loss whether or not Covered Property sustains damage: (1) the cost of removal and disposal of debris of property covered hereunder wherever the property may be; (2) the cost of removal and disposal of debris of property not covered hereunder from a Location of an Insured; (3) the cost of recycling debris of property removed including the reasonable cost of cleaning, sorting, separating, segregating, transporting and disposing of such debris to a recycling center.
Professional Fees: This policy covers the costs incurred by the insured, including reasonable fees payable to the Insured's accountants, architects, auditors, engineers, loss control consultants or other professionals, for producing and certifying any particulars or details contained in the Insured's books or documents, or such other proofs, information or evidence required by the Insurer resulting from insured loss under this policy for which the Insurer has accepted liability.
Coverage shall also apply to Insured / Loss Payee’s management expenses and / or consulting expense, including construction management fees. This payment will be based on any agreed upon percentage by contract, or as shown with the production of proof of loss documentation, including any supporting invoices/time sheets/contracts/etc. This shall include any fees, management or otherwise, that an Insured or Loss Payee under the policy becomes contractually obligated to pay as a result of the physical loss or damage to the property, whether to a third party or inter-company/inter-insured charges. Coverage shall not include the fees and costs of public Page 5 of 6 adjusters or loss appraisers including any of their subsidiary, related or associated entities either partially or wholly owned by them or retained by them for the purpose of assisting them.
Priority Of Payments (Applicable To Excess Placements): It is warranted by the insured, and a condition of coverage under this policy, that the Insured shall maintain in full force and effect during the term of this policy the underlying policy (ies). Failure to do so will not invalidate this policy, however at that time this policy will apply as if the underlying policy (ies) remained in full force.
In no event shall the coverage hereunder apply until: 1) the underlying limit(s) of liability of the underlying policy(ies) is exhausted; and 2) as a result of one occurrence for all locations and coverages combined, the amount of loss, damage, or expense arising out of any one occurrence exceeds $ATTACHMENT LIMIT plus the applicable underlying policy(ies) deductible(s) and any waiting period attributable to the perils, property and coverages insured hereunder.
In the event there is no recovery available to the insured as a result of any underlying insurer’s inability to pay for whatever reason, including but not limited to insolvency or financial impairment of any underlying insurer, the coverage hereunder shall nonetheless apply in excess of the applicable limit of liability in the underlying policy(ies).
This policy shall not apply as excess insurance for any loss not insured by this policy.
In determining the amount of any loss or damage over which this policy is excess, the combined total loss caused by any peril(s) resulting in loss or damage to any property or coverages insured under any underlying insurance shall be used, even though all such perils, property or coverages insured by the underlying policy may not be insured against by this excess policy.
In the event of loss caused by or resulting from more than one peril or coverage, the limit of liability of the primary and any underlying excess policy(ies) shall apply first to the peril(s) or coverage(s) not insured by this policy, and the remainder, if any, shall apply to the peril(s) or coverage(s) insured hereunder.
Any recoveries made under the primary policy shall be treated as applying first in satisfaction of the loss to property and coverages not insured against by this excess policy.
